# common-footer
A common footer for @OpenOakland web and mobile apps

*Why?*

OpenOakland runs more than a dozen web sites and apps, no two with the same content, appearance, or navigation. 

Let's craft one master footer that can be incorporated into all of our apps 

In a way that
- Is easy to include in apps
- Is easy to update globally
- Reflects best UX practices
- Doesn't impose huge bandwidth or time costs to users
- Extensible for app-specific features
 
So that
- OpenOakland achieves more consistency across sites without inhibiting a project team
- Project teams get a feature for free
- Users get the benefits from a great page footer

*What content should the footer have that's not specific to the app?* 

First thoughts... 
- Link to OpenOakland.org home
- OpenOakland logo and name/signature and slogan
- Copyright statement 
    - Copyright first-year to this-year OpenOakland. All rights reserved. (or whatever the statement should be). 
    - Link to license details? 
    - Provision for parts that aren't public domain like commercial components? 
- Link to "About OpenOakland" 
- "Made By Oakland Volunteers" text
- Other OpenOakland Apps - see other apps that might interest you
- Subscribe to updates - OO announce-only mailing list 
- Join OpenOakland - CTA for membership
- Support OpenOakland - CTA for sponsorship or tip jar

*What kinds of app-specific footer content should we provide for?*
- Site map
- Full name of the app
- App tag line 
- Project Credits
- App's FAQ
- Colophon (the tools we used)
- Subscribe to updates about this app (e.g. major updates to the app, new election cycle, big influx of fresh data)

*Prior art*

From OpenOakland... 


From highly trafficed sites where they presumably test UX and make every byte and pixel count...
